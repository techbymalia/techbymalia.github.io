                <h2>Why I Prefer Dogs Over Cats</h2>
                <p>I prefer dogs over cats because dogs are very loyal and they have tons of energy to spend time with you. Dogs also sense when there's danger nearby or a sickness their owner has. Another reason is because Dogs are very funny, they can learn tons of tricks, and they can do what humans do only better. Lastly, dogs can be your bestfriend forever.</p>
